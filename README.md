# Customer segmentation---divide customers into segments based on common characteristics

# Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to use unsupervised machine learning algorithms to segment credit card customers into groups based on their behaviors.
Once we segment the customers into groups, we can further analyze each group which help us to understand what will most resonate with our consumers and help guide key decisions.
